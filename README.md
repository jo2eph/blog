## Summary

Welcome to my personal blog, where I use this platform to explore ideas, share projects, personal thoughts, and break down complex concepts across STEM and beyond.

Whether you're a student, professional, academic, or just someone who loves learning, you’ll find posts here that aim to inform, inspire, and occasionally challenge the way we think about STEM. Anyone from any field is welcome, as I'm someone who's navigating it all and learning along the way as well.

Any [correction or suggestion](https://github.com/jo2eph/blog/issues/new) is greatly appreciated.
