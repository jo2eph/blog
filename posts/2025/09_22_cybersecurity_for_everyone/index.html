                <p>
                    In simple terms, <b>cybersecurity</b> is the art of defending against online threats.
                    <br>
                    It involves keeping yourself and your information safe from hackers, scammers, and other malicious actors.

                    You might be wondering, 
                    <i>&quot;Why should I care about cybersecurity? I&apos;m just a regular person. I'm not a likely target.&quot;</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The truth is:

                    <br>
                    You don't need to be a celebrity or part of a large corporation.
                    You don't need to be a small business owner or a government official.
                    You don't even need to have anything valuable online.

                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Phishing attacks can come in many forms. They can show up as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Emails</b> that look like it comes from a trusted source, but are actually fake.

                            <b>Text messages</b> asking you to verify your account or click on a link.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Fake websites</b> that look like a real website from a trusted company, 
                            but are designed to steal your information.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    It often uses urgent language to create a sense of panic, with messages
                    like &quot;<i>Your account has been compromised, click here to reset your password</i>&quot;.
                    <br>
                    The goal is to get you to click on a link or download an attachment that will install malware on your computer, 
                    or take you to a fake website that looks like the real one, 
                    where you&apos;ll be asked to enter your personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phishing attacks can be so convincing that even the most tech-savvy individuals can fall for them.
                    <br>
                    The best defense against a phishing attack is to always be skeptical of any messages, calls, emails, or websites that ask for your personal information.

                <p>
                    <b>Password attacks</b> are attempts to gain access to your account by guessing or cracking your passwords.
                    <br>
                    There are several types of password attacks, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brute Force Attacks</li>
                        <li>Dictionary Attacks</li>

                        <b>Brute Force Attacks:</b> 
                        This is when an attacker tries every possible combination of passwords until they find the correct one.
                        <br>
                        This can be very time-consuming, but it can be quicker if the password is weak, short, or common.
                        <br>
                        <b>Dictionary Attacks:</b> 
                        This is when an attacker uses a list of common words or phrases to guess your password.
                        <br>
                        <b>Credential Stuffing:</b> 
                        This is when an attacker uses a list of stolen usernames and passwords to try and gain access to your accounts.
                        <br>
                        This is especially effective if you reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Social engineering</b> is a type of attack that relies on manipulating people to gain access or to steal information.
                    <br>
                    It often involves building trust with the victim using deception, psychological manipulation, or impersonation of a trusted entity.
                    <br>
                    Unlike typical cyber attacks that exploit technical vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits human psychology.
                    <br>
                    It can take many forms, with phishing being one of the most common examples.
                    <br>
                    Other examples include pretexting (creating a false sense of trust), baiting (offering something enticing to lure victims), and tailgating (following someone into a secure area).
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of social engineering is when an attacker pretends to be a tech support and convinces you to give them access to your computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always be cautious with unexpected requests for information or access, even if they seem to come from a trusted source.
                    <br>
                    Always verify the identity of the person or organization before sharing any sensitive information.

                    <b>Man-in-the-middle</b> (MitM) attacks occur when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, such as between you and a website, or between you and someone else online.

                    This can happen on unsecured Wi-Fi networks, where an attacker can listen in on your internet traffic and steal your information.
                    <br>
                    Attacks like MitM are why it&apos;s important to <b>avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities</b>, such as online banking, shopping, or work-related tasks.

                        <li>
                            Using weak or easy-to-guess passwords,
                            which makes it easy for attackers to gain access to their accounts.

                        <li>
                            Including personal information, such as their name, birthdate, or address, as part of their password.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using most commonly used passwords, such as &quot;password&quot;, &quot;123456&quot;, or &quot;qwerty&quot;.
                            <br>

                        </li>
                        <li>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Here are some tips for creating strong passwords,
                    according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Passwords should be <b>at least 12 characters long</b>,
                            but longer is better.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use a <b>mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Do NOT use common words or phrases</b>, such as &quot;password&quot; or &quot;123456&quot;.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Avoid using personal information</b>, such as your name, birthdate, or address.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, strong passwords can be difficult to remember, especially when you have a lot of them.
                    <br>
                    This is where <b>password managers</b> come in.

                <p>
                    A <b>password manager</b> is a software that helps you generate, store, and manage your passwords.
                    <br>
                    It can create strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, and store them securely so you don&apos;t have to remember them all.
                    <br>
                    All you need to remember is one strong password to access your account, and the password manager takes care of the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Password managers can also help you identify weak or reused passwords, and alert you if any of your accounts have been compromised in a data breach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key takeaway here is that <b>using a password manager is one of the best things you can do for your online security</b>.
                    <br>
                    So, if you&apos;re not already using one, consider getting a reputable password manager.

                <p>
                    <b>Multi-Factor Authentication</b> (MFA) is an additional layer of security that requires you to provide two or more forms of verification to prove it's really you.
                    <br>
                    This typically involves something you know (like your password), and something you have (like a code sent to your phone).
                    <br>
                    Some common forms of MFA include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Biometric authentication (e.g. fingerprint or facial recognition)</li>
                        <li>Text or email codes</li>
                        <li>One time passwords (OTP) generated by an app or sent via SMS</li>
                        <li>Physical security keys, like a USB security key or a hardware token</li>
                        <li>App-based authentication (like Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    MFA can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your accounts.
                    <br>
                    Even if an attacker manages to guess or steal your password, they would still need the second form of identification to access your account.
                    <br>
                    Many popular services, such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, 
                    and even banks, email providers, and online shopping sites
                    offer MFA options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key takeaway here is that 
                    <b>enabling MFA on your accounts is one of the best things you can do for your online security</b>.
                    <br>
                    Don&apos;t rely on just passwords alone to protect your accounts.
                    They can be guessed, stolen, or cracked.
                    <br>
                    So, if you&apos;re not already using it, consider enabling MFA on all of your accounts that support it.

                <p>
                    Another important thing to keep in mind: <b>do NOT use security questions as a form of MFA</b>.
                    <br>
                    In case you&apos;re not familiar, security questions are questions that you answer to verify your identity,

                    <br>
                    Security questions are one of the weakest forms of authentication. 
                    <br>
                    They&apos;re often easy to guess. 
                    Worse, the answers can be found with a quick search through your social media.

                    6. HTTPS
                </h2>
                
                <p>
                    In simple terms, 
                    <b>HTTP</b> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is essentially a way  your web browser talks to websites, and
                    <br>
                    <b>HTTPS</b> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of that communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike HTTP, HTTPS uses encryption to protect your data from being intercepted or tampered with by attackers.
                    <br>
                    This means that when you use HTTP, any data you send (like passwords or messages) is sent in plain text.
                    <br>
                    Thus, anyone who is eavesdropping (especially on public Wi-Fi) can see exactly what you are sending.
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, when you use HTTPS,
                    your data gets &quot;scrambled&quot; into a mess of 
                    characters while it travels over the internet.
                    <br>
                    That way, 
                    only the website you&apos;re sending it to can unscramble the message and read it properly.
                    <br>
                    This ensures your information is secure as it travels from your computer over the internet.
                    <br>
                    (More about this in the 
                    <a href="#cryptography">
                        Cryptography: A Very Brief Overview</a> section).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can tell if a website is using HTTPS by looking for the padlock icon in the address bar of your web browser, 
                    or by checking if the URL starts with &quot;https://&quot; instead of &quot;http://&quot;.
                </p>

                    <img src="./assets/HTTPS_example.png" alt="HTTPS Example" title="HTTPS Example">

                <p>
                    When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your data is encrypted, 
                    which means that even if an attacker intercepts it, they won&apos;t be able to read it.
                    <br>
                    This is especially important when you&apos;re entering sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details.

                <p>
                    If a website does NOT use HTTPS,

                    7. Software Updates
                </h2>

                <p>
                    <b>Keeping your software up to date is one of the simplest and most effective ways to protect yourself online</b>.
                    <br>
                    Software updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
                    <br>
                    This includes your operating system, web browser, antivirus software, and any other apps you use regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Don&apos;t ignore software update notifications. They matter more than you think.</b>
                    <br>
                    Many people delay or ignore software updates because they find them inconvenient or annoying.
                    <br>
                    However, this can leave your computer vulnerable to attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key takeaway here is: <b>keep your software up to date. It is one of the best things you can do for your online security</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if you&apos;re not already doing it, make sure to enable automatic updates whenever possible, 
                    and regularly check for updates for all of your software.
                    <br>
                    Yes, updates can be annoying, but protecting yourself is always worth a little inconvenience.

                    8. How to Detect and Defend Against Phishing Attempts
                </h2>
                
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, phishing is one of the most common online threats.
                    <br>
                    It can be difficult to spot a phishing attempt, 
                    especially if it looks like it&apos;s coming from a trusted source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some tips to help you spot scams and phishing attempts,
                    and protect yourself from them:
                </p>

                <h3>
                    8.1 Be Skeptical of Urgent Requests
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Phishing attempts often use urgent language or tone to create panic, 
                    making users respond to an emergency that never actually existed.
                    <br>
                    Be skeptical of any messages that ask you to take immediate action, such as 
                    <br>
                    &quot;<i>Your account has been compromised, click here to reset your password</i>&quot;.
                    <br>
                    Always be suspicious of urgent requests for personal information or access, 
                    even if they seem to come from a trusted source.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    8.2 Check the Sender&apos;s Email Address or Phone Number
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Phishing messages often come from email addresses or phone numbers that look very similar, but are not legitimate. 
                    <br>
                    Always double-check the sender&apos;s details before trusting the message.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    8.3 Look for Spelling and Grammatical Errors
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Many phishing messages contain spelling or grammar mistakes,
                    while legitimate organizations usually have professional communication standards.
                    <br>
                    So, check for any spelling and grammatical errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, be aware that some phishing attempts can be very well-written and free of errors.
                    <br>
                    So, don&apos;t rely solely on this tip to spot phishing attempts.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    8.4 Hover Over Links to See the URL
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Before clicking on <i>any</i> link, no matter where you found it (email, text message, website, social media, etc.),
                    <br>
                    <b>hover your mouse over it to see the URL</b>.
                    <br>
                    This will show you the actual URL that the link will take you to,
                    which you can usually see in the bottom left corner of your web browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, hover over the following link that looks like it leads to Google:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com" title="Google">
                        https://www.google.com
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice how even though the text says &quot;https://www.google.com&quot;, it actually leads to YouTube.
                    <br>
                    This example is harmless, but you can imagine how this technique can be used for malicious purposes.
                    <br>
                    The link text can say anything, but the actual URL can take you to a completely different website, usually a fake one designed to steal your information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the URL looks suspicious or doesn&apos;t match the text of the link, don&apos;t click on it.
                    <br>
                    Instead, go directly to the website by typing the URL into your web browser&apos;s address bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, be cautious of shortened URLs (like bit.ly links), as they can hide the true destination.
                    <br>
                    Use a URL expander service to see the full URL before clicking on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Get into the habit of NEVER trusting any link you see,
                    ALWAYS verifying everything.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    8.5 Verify the Website&apos;s Security
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Before entering any sensitive information on a website, 
                    <br>
                    make sure the website is using HTTPS 
                    (recall the HTTPS section earlier).
                    <br>
                    If the website is not using HTTPS, do NOT enter any sensitive information.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    8.6 Trust Your Instincts
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If something seems off, or too good to be true, it probably is.
                    <br>
                    Trust your instincts and be cautious when something doesn&apos;t feel right.
                    <br>
                    It's better to just ignore it, rather than risking a phishing attack.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    8.6 NEVER Trust, ALWAYS Verify
                </h3>
                <p>
                    ALWAYS verify the identity of anyone asking for sensitive information.
                    <br>
                    ALWAYS verify the legitimacy of a website, link, email, etc. before interacting with it.
                    <br>
                    Even if it seems to come from someone you know, or from trusted sources, 
                    ALWAYS verify their identity and the legitimacy of their requests.
                    <br>
                    Make &quot;<b>NEVER trust, ALWAYS verify</b>&quot; your default online habit.
                    It's one of the best habits to build, and one of the best ways to stay safe online.
                    <br>
                    So, get into the habit of &quot;NEVER trust, ALWAYS verify&quot;.

                    Here are some recommended best practices and habits to help you stay safe online (<i>Note that some of these are repeats of what has been said earlier, but these are worth repeating</i>):
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>NEVER trust, ALWAYS verify:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Make &quot;NEVER trust, ALWAYS verify&quot; your online default habit. 
                            It is one of the best ways to stay safe online.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Always check links, sender identities, and the legitimacy of requests.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Avoiding using public Wi-Fi:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, which makes it easier for attackers to intercept and steal your information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid doing sensitive activities, such as online banking, shopping, or work-related tasks, on public Wi-Fi.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you must use it, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and keep your data safe.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Limit the amount of personal information you share online:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Be cautious about sharing personal information on social media or other websites. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sharing too much personal info can make it easier for attackers to use social engineering to access your accounts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid sharing sensitive information, such as your home address, phone number, or financial information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Adjust your privacy settings to control who can see your posts.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Regularly back up your important files to an external hard drive or cloud storage service.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                <h2>
                    10. Cryptography: A Very Brief Overview
                </h2>
                
                <p>
                    In simple terms, <b>cryptography</b> is the mathematical science of securing information in the presence of adversaries.
                    <br>
                    It involves using complex math and algorithms to protect sensitive information from being intercepted or modified by attackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The details of cryptography and how it works are beyond the scope of this blog post.
                    <br>
                    You don&apos;t need to understand how cryptography works to stay safe online, 
                    but it helps to know it&apos;s working in the background to protect your data.
                    <br>
                    That said, here are some key concepts to understand:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Encryption:</b>
                            <br>
                            The process of converting plaintext (human-readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using a mathematical algorithm and a key.
                            This ensures that only those with the key can read the original data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Decryption:</b>
                            <br>
                            The opposite of encryption: converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate key.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Symmetric cryptography:</b> 
                            <br>
                            Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
                            This is fast and efficient, but sharing the same key securely can be difficult.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Asymmetric cryptography:</b>
                            <br>
                            Uses a pair of keys: a <b>public key</b> and a <b>private key</b>.
                            <br>
                            The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption.
                            <br>
                            As the name suggests, public keys can be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept secret.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Many secure websites use asymmetric cryptography through HTTPS, which allows your browser to encrypt data sent to the server without needing a shared key.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once again, you do not need to understand the details of how cryptography works, or the math behind it.
                    <br>
                    As a matter of fact, you should not try to implement your own cryptographic systems.
                    These are best left to experts who dedicate their lives to rigorously researching and improving cryptography.
                    <br>
                    The key takeaway here is that 
                    <b>cryptography is a powerful tool for your online security</b>,
                    and it&apos;s good to be aware of the mathematics and algorithms that help to keep our data secured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are interested in learning more about cryptography, there are many resources available online, 
                    including books, articles, and online courses.
                    It&apos;s a fascinating field, and if you&apos;re curious, I highly recommend exploring it.

                    But cybersecurity isn&apos;t about perfection; it&apos;s about awareness, preparation, and smart habits. 
                    And the more informed you are, the safer you will be.

                <p>
                    Remember: cybersecurity is not a one-time action. 
                    It&apos;s an ongoing process. 
                    Stay informed, stay curious, and continue to develop good security habits.

                    But this is just the beginning.

                    I really hope you didn't blindly click on those links, 
                    especially after reading this blog.
                    <br>
                    If you clicked on those links without checking them first... consider this a friendly wake-up call.
                    <br>
                    If I had been a malicious actor, those links could have taken you to dangerous phishing sites.
                    <br>
                    If you trusted me just because I wrote this blog and seem like a helpful source,
                    that&apos;s exactly how social engineering works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So remember:
                    <br>
                    <b>
                        NEVER trust. ALWAYS verify.
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Get in the habit of hovering over links, checking the URL, and verifying,
                    no matter where the link came from.
                    <br>
                    Let's break your bad security habits starting today.
